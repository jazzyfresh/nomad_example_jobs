## The `meta` Stanza

The meta stanza can be used to provide unstructured key-value data to a Nomad job as an automatically-exported environment variable.  This variable can be used as provided or can be used for more complex expressions via the Nomad `template` stanza

Documentation for the meta stanza can be found [here](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/meta) in the official Nomad documentation.

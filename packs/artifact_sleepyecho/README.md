## artifact_sleepyecho

Purpose:

This sample was designed to pull a shell script from an AWS S3 bucket and
run it locally.  Some additional smarts were included in the shell script
to enable it to simulate more conditions.  

The job as committed is somewhat uninteresting, but can be changed up to
add Vault Support, Template Stanza testing, Consul KV output.  This should
be considered a building block to be used for more robust reproducers.
